        <h2>World Wide Web</h2>
        <p>
            History:
            <br>
            Tim Berners-Lee invented the web while working at CERN to solve document management issues and enable collaboration beyond CERN, using a decentralized, hypertext-based approach.
            <br>
            He submitted a proposal in 1989, and by 1990, a working system with the WorldWideWeb browser was developed.
            <br>
            The technology spread beyond CERN in 1991.
            <br>
            CERN's release of Web protocols in 1993 led to rapid web growth, with browsers like Mosaic and Netscape contributing.
            <br>
            Berners-Lee founded W3C to establish web standards like XML and HTML5.
            <br>
            The World Wide Web has become a central tool for billions of people in the Information Age.
