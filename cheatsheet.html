        <h2>World Wide Web</h2>
        <p>
            History:
            <br>
            Tim Berners-Lee invented the web while working at CERN to solve document management issues and enable collaboration beyond CERN, using a decentralized, hypertext-based approach.
            <br>
            He submitted a proposal in 1989, and by 1990, a working system with the WorldWideWeb browser was developed.
            <br>
            The technology spread beyond CERN in 1991.
            <br>
            CERN's release of Web protocols in 1993 led to rapid web growth, with browsers like Mosaic and Netscape contributing.
            <br>
            Berners-Lee founded W3C to establish web standards like XML and HTML5.
            <br>
            The World Wide Web has become a central tool for billions of people in the Information Age.

            Uniform Resource Locator (URL):
            <br>
            A URL is a string that represents a unique address for a resource on the Internet. It consists of different parts that together provide information about how to find the resource.
            <br>
            Protocol (Scheme): The protocol in a URL specifies how the resource should be accessed. Examples of protocols include "http://" for web pages and "ftp://" for file transfers.
            <br>
            Authority: Authority is the part of the URL that contains information about the server or website on which the resource is hosted. This can include the hostname (e.g. "www.example.com") and the optional port (e.g. ":80" for HTTP).
            <br>
            Path: The path in a URL indicates where the resource is located on the server. It can represent a sequence of directories and file names that define the path to the resource.
            <br>
            Query: The query component is optional and allows additional information to be sent to the server to request or filter specific content. It is often followed by a question mark and contains key-value pairs (e.g. "?search=keyword").
            <br>
            Fragment: The fragment is also optional and is followed by a "#". It is often used to refer to a specific section within a page, such as: B. an anchor within a long article.
