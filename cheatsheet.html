                    History:
                    <br>
                    Tim Berners-Lee invented the web while working at CERN to solve document management issues and enable collaboration beyond CERN, using a decentralized, hypertext-based approach.
                    <br>
                    He submitted a proposal in 1989, and by 1990, a working system with the WorldWideWeb browser was developed.
                    <br>
                    The technology spread beyond CERN in 1991.
                    <br>
                    CERN's release of Web protocols in 1993 led to rapid web growth, with browsers like Mosaic and Netscape contributing.
                    <br>
                    Berners-Lee founded W3C to establish web standards like XML and HTML5.
                    <br>
                    The World Wide Web has become a central tool for billions of people in the Information Age.

                    Uniform Resource Locator (URL):
                    <br>
                    A URL is a string that represents a unique address for a resource on the Internet. It consists of different parts that together provide information about how to find the resource.
                    <br>
                    Protocol (Scheme): The protocol in a URL specifies how the resource should be accessed. Examples of protocols include "http://" for web pages and "ftp://" for file transfers.
                    <br>
                    Authority: Authority is the part of the URL that contains information about the server or website on which the resource is hosted. This can include the hostname (e.g. "www.example.com") and the optional port (e.g. ":80" for HTTP).
                    <br>
                    Path: The path in a URL indicates where the resource is located on the server. It can represent a sequence of directories and file names that define the path to the resource.
                    <br>
                    Query: The query component is optional and allows additional information to be sent to the server to request or filter specific content. It is often followed by a question mark and contains key-value pairs (e.g. "?search=keyword").
                    <br>
                    Fragment: The fragment is also optional and is followed by a "#". It is often used to refer to a specific section within a page, such as: B. an anchor within a long article.

                    A web server is computer software and underlying hardware that accepts requests over the HTTP protocol (or its secure variant, HTTPS).
                    <br>
                    A web server accepts requests from user agents such as web browsers or web crawlers and responds with either the contents of a requested resource or an error message.
                    <br>
                    Content can be stored on a web server as either pre-existing files (static content) or at request runtime (dynamic content). These resources can be stored on the server itself if the server configuration allows it.
                    <br>
                    Content in web pages is usually described by the HTML code, which defines the layout and structure of the web page. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) can be used for formatting and displaying the content. The "content" mentioned in the text refers to the data displayed in web pages, be it text, images, videos or other elements presented in a human-readable form.

                    A web client is software or a device that accesses web services or resources on the Internet. It is used to display and retrieve web pages and other information from the Internet.
                    <br>
                    A web client retrieves information from the Internet and displays it to the user. This can include viewing web pages, downloading files, or accessing web applications.
                    <br>
                    A web client and a web browser are not the same thing, although they can perform similar tasks. A web browser is a type of web client specifically designed for viewing web pages. However, a web client can also perform other tasks, such as retrieving data from APIs or communicating with web applications without displaying web pages.

                    The HTML head element is a container in an HTML page that contains metadata and information about the document that is not directly displayed on the web page. These can be titles, font definitions, links to external files.
                    <br>
                    !DOCTYPE html is a declaration at the beginning of an HTML document and indicates the type of the document, in this case HTML5. It tells the browser which version of HTML is being used to correctly interpret the page.
                    <br>
                    The top two elements within the html element are the head element and the body element. The head element contains metadata, links (etc..), while the body element contains the visible content of the web page.
                    <br>
                    To emphasize text in HTML, use the em element or the strong element. em emphasizes the text in italics, while strong emphasizes the text in bold.
                    <br>
                    To mark text in HTML, use mark or to mark it in a color use span.
